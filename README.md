## Shopping List POC

This is a small POC of a shopping list utilising a published library of web components. The POC assumes there are already items on the list. Add to cart is only a mock alert, but the remove action will remove the item from the list (although the state is not persisted).

The primary purpose of this POC is to see React and Web Components in action. The following components are make using StencilJS. The POC is best viewed on a smaller viewport (< 700px).

- Headings
- Copy
- Buttons
- Product tiles
- Images
